# TerasologyInstallers
This repository contains installers for various different Linux distributions to install Terasology. (This is still a work in progress and has not yet been tested!))

All the distributions tested were at their latest versions (or close enough).

# Packages:
  * .deb
  * .rpm

## .deb:  
### Tested Distributions:
* Ubuntu
* Debian (the original)
 * Notes:
 The GNOME desktop enviroment was used but the package manager installed perfectly so any GUI could work potentially.
 
## .rpm:
### Tested Distributions:
* Fedora
* OpenSUSE:
 * Notes: Once again the choice of desktop enviroment was GNOME.
