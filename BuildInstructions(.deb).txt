Create a .tar.gz file called terasology-launcher-3.1.0.tar.gz from the modified Terasology Launcher files located at https://github.com/BenjaminAmos/TerasologyInstallers/blob/master/TerasologyLauncher.zip.

Start off by generating the files from the tar.gz: Use the command "sudo alien -k terasology-launcher-3.1.0.tar.gz -g -c --fixperms" (without the quotes).

Now run the command: "bzr dh-make terasology-launcher 3.1.0 terasology-launcher-3.1.0.tar.gz
". The command will generate a terasology-launcher folder and populate it with the files needed to build the deb.

As suggested in the documentation cd into terasology-launcher/debian/ and then type: "rm *ex *EX".

Rename the rules file in terasology-launcher/debian to rules.old.

Then copy the rules file from terasology-launcher-3.1.0/debain into terasology-launcher/debain.

Delete the terasology-launcher-3.1.0 folder (requires root).

Edit the copyright file to change the license to Apache-2.0 and edit the control file to add the name, summary and description. The settings I used are as follows:

Package: terasology-launcher
Architecture: all
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: This is the launcher for Terasology
 Terasology is a minecraft-like game where you can create and destroy blocks.

Once done, run the command "bzr builddeb -- -us -uc" to build the .deb file. Ignore the warnings, it works perfectly anyway.

Double click on the produced deb in the build-area folder to install it. It should install the application to /opt.

Run the launcher to see if it works.

If you need to remove the package then just run the command: "sudo apt-get remove terasology-launcher".
